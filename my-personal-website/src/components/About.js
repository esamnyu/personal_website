    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm an aspiring Security Engineer/Software Developer with expertise in cybersecurity auditing and software development. 
      Currently pursuing my Master's degree in Cybersecurity at NYU, I have a GPA of 3.93 and a drive to learn and grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love tackling complex problems, enhancing system security, and occasionally cracking a joke to keep things light. 
      When I'm not coding or studying, you'll find me indulging in my favorite hobbies or exploring new tech trends.
